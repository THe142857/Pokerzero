# Contest overview


## What is UPAC?

UPAC (University Poker Algorithm Competition) is a virtual contest that aims to bring together students from around the world to compete in developing the best poker algorithms.

We plan to host formal contests with different formats and prizes. The first contest will be a heads-up no-limit Texas Hold'em competition. The competition will be held on the UPAC platform, which is a custom-built platform for running poker competitions.

The platform is currently live for testing, and for fun, but the first official contest will be held in Fall 2024.

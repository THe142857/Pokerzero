# Developing bots

## The game
Bots play 2-player Texas Holdem' with fixed blinds. We chose this format 
instead of larger games or tournament style because it has fewer factors for bots to deal with.
This way you can focus on understanding your opponent and betting intelligently.

## How to play
At the start of the game the 'button' is assigned to a random player.
Before every round the button is forced to put the small blind into the pot ($1),
and the other player is forced to put the big blind ($2).
